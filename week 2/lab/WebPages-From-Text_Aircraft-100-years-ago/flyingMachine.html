            <p>
                In the opinion of competent experts it is idle to look for a commercial
                future for the flying machine. There is, and always will be, a limit to
                its carrying capacity which will prohibit its employment for passenger
                or freight purposes in a wholesale or general way. There are some, of
                course, who will argue that because a machine will carry two people
                another may be constructed that will carry a dozen, but those who make
                this contention do not understand the theory of weight sustentation in
                the air; or that the greater the load the greater must be the lifting
                power (motors and plane surface), and that there is a limit to these--as
                will be explained later on--beyond which the aviator cannot go.

            <h1>Some Practical Uses.</h1>
            the same time there are fields in which the flying machine may be
            used to great advantage. These are:
            <ul>
                <li>

                    Sports--Flying machine races or flights will always be popular by reason
                    of the element of danger. It is a strange, but nevertheless a true
                    proposition, that it is this element which adds zest to all sporting
                    events.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scientific--For exploration of otherwise inaccessible regions such as
                    deserts, mountain tops, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reconnoitering--In time of war flying machines may be used to advantage
                    to spy out an enemy's encampment, ascertain its defenses, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>

                With regard to designing and building aircraft, New Zealand is doing nothing worth mentioning.
                New Zealand has one aircraft, a Bleriot imported from France.
