				Monkeys are haplorhine primates, a group generally possessing tails and
				consisting of about 260 known living species. Many monkey species are
				tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily
				 on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the
				 day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent,
				 particularly Old World monkeys.
